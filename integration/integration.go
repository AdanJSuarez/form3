Hi ðŸ‘‹

According to the documentation the following fields are deprecated:

title (superseded by name)
first_name
bank_account_name

alternative_bank_account_names (superseded by alternative_names)

However those changes don't seem to be implemented in the docker api provided - form3tech/interview-accountapi:v1.0.0-4-g63cf8434. The fields name and alternative_names are being ignored.

Additionally the switched field doesn't persist in the database nor is returned from the API on account creation.

-----------------

Hi,

During account create op for UK account with minimal payload(non CoP) is returning 400 error with message
"account_classification in body should be one of [Personal Business]"

But according to the doc it's a non required param and only used for the CoP request.

This is creating a bit of confusion on required and non required data.

--

I am not sure if this is the expected behaviour but I have figured what was the issue. I was testing the Create API without omitting empty fields and thus having "account_classification": "" in the payload.

Failed Payload: failed-payload.txt

According to the doc almost all the CoP fields are optional except the name field. Strangely, when I removed only the account_classification field it magically worked but I suspect that it shouldn't!

The required CoP name field that I have passed should have triggered a validation error as this is a required field and I have passed an array of empty strings!
"name": [ "", "", "", "" ]

Also, When I am passing the name and alternative_names correctly, they are not being set correctly.
Here is payload: req-resp-payload.txt

No account_number and iban are being generated. Also status field is missing in the response.
