## Client library

The library is a Go library to be use as so. For simplicity, it implements only limited functionality of the Account endpoints of Form3.

For accounts, it implements:
- `Create` a new bank account.
- `Fetch` a bank account.
- `Delete` a bank account.

## Run
It requires docker and docker-compose. After the installation you need to type:

`docker-compose up`

## Tests
The description says the following: `Be well tested to the level you would expect in a commercial environment. Note that tests are expected to run against the provided fake account API.`

To fullfil this requirement, I implemented two groups, unit tests and integration tests. The integration test are the one that will run against
the provided fake account API.
- The unit tests are located in each module.
- The integration tests are in a specific folder called `integration`.

## Unit test coverage
Unfortunately the mocks reduce the total code coverage because they are included when coverage is calculated. Also there is a couple of scenarios not covered but they are two functions from the standard library. Other than that, the coverage is 100%

## Mocks

I created my unit tests using mocks generated by [Mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery). There are two opposite approach related to mocks, there are teams that commit them to the repository and there are team that don't. There are pros and cons, so it is usually a matter of team decision. The ones in favour say that when committing them you eliminate the needs for generate them, that sometimes require external libraries/software. The others, consider that mocks are a tool to help with the tests, they should not be in the repo, so you generate them when you needed them.

I this case I didn't commit the mocks, but the unit tests doesn't pass without them. In the `Dockerfile` I included a `RUN` conditioned to success on the installation of Mockery, in a way that, if it fails, the unit tests will not run to avoid the failure of running all tests: unit and integration. At the end, the requirement of the exercise is to see the tests running against the fake API (integration test).

If the Mockery installation fails for any reason when creating the image after `docker-compose up`, you still can to run the unit tests at `docker-compose up`:
- Get Mockery. There are different instructions depend on your system/preference [link](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/installation/#github-release)
- Generate the mocks based on the instruction. You would need to add the following Mockery flag: `--inpackage` to generate the mocks, only if the way you chose wasn't `go generate ./...`
- Uncomment line 16 in Dockerfile. It has a note.
- Run `docker-compose up`.

## Vendor

Like with mocks, there is a discussion of committing the dependencies or not to your repo. At the end, it depends of the team.
I saw in your client [repo](https://github.com/form3tech-oss/go-form3) you included it, therefore I took the same approach.

## Function/Method Documentation

I saw in your public repos that you don't usually document the function/methods, not even the public ones -mainly, some are- There are different approaches to function documentation and like the other things, that is a team decision. I decided to document the public interface for Account. This is a library and for me, at least the public functionality, should be documented.

# Production readiness
## Configuration

This implementation of client library needs basically two parameters to run. The `Form3 URL` and the `account path`.
To set those parameters I implemented two different ways. One is setting them as parameters when instantiate form3 object and the other is read them from the environment variables. For production ready, it should include a third case that could be read them from a file like `yaml` or `toml`. I decided to not implement that case because it will require either implement a parser for those files or include a third-party library that I am not allowed based on the instruction.

## Retry mechanism

The API documentation encourage us to implement a [retry mechanism](https://www.api-docs.form3.tech/api/schemes/sepa-instant-credit-transfer/introduction/timeouts/retry-strategy) on failure. I implemented the exponential back-off retry algorithm set in pseudo-code.

## Headers

The exercise requirements say to not implement authentication so I didn't do anything about it. For production ready we should include the Authentication header.

## Create

The instruction require to be simple and concise, so only implemented tha basic functionality for `Create`. One nice feature could be the possibility to pass parameters for creation instead of passing the `model.Data` The values that the user doesn't change often, could be set through configuration make it even simpler.
